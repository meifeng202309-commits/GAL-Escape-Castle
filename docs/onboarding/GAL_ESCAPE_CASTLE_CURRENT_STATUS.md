## 1. Project dashboard

```text
CURRENT_SPRINT        = ACT1–13 Level2 closure remediation
CURRENT_GATE          = LEVEL2_TARGETED_INDEPENDENT_CLOSURE_AUDIT_FAIL
CURRENT_OWNER         = CD
NEXT_REQUIRED_ACTION  = CD closes residual IDA-001, IDA-002, IDA-004 and IDA-005 gaps on correction baseline b4248132842a2e660ca1ba4e15605eff75c78dff, preserves deployed migrations 001–039, adds required runtime closure evidence/regressions, then submits another Level2 Targeted Independent Closure Audit request; Sprint7 remains blocked

MEMORY_SYSTEM         = ACTIVE
MEMORY_SYSTEM_START   = GA-001 / 2026-09-20
```

Visual production continues in parallel.

## 2. Action Log checkpoints

CA has completed its latest 10-action checkpoint through CA-090.

```text
GA_CHECKPOINT = NONE
CA_CHECKPOINT = CA-090
CD_CHECKPOINT = NONE
VA_CHECKPOINT = NONE
```

Universal cold-start entry:

```text
docs/onboarding/START_HERE.md
```

## 3. Current canonical / governance set

```text
L1 / current canonical:
docs/specs/current/古堡逃脱游戏脚本 V4.0.md
docs/specs/current/Codex程序开发说明书 V2.4.md
docs/specs/current/Castle Visual V2.1.md
docs/specs/current/从创意到游戏成品的研发流程V1.0.md
docs/specs/current/localization/GAL_Castle_Escape_Text_Catalog_V1.0.csv
assets/asset-registry.json

L2 / governance:
agent-comms/inter_agent_talk_protocol V1.md
docs/onboarding/START_HERE.md
docs/onboarding/GAL_ESCAPE_CASTLE_开发项目新成员指南_V1.0.md
docs/onboarding/GAL_ESCAPE_CASTLE_Agent_Action_Log_Rules_V1.0.md
docs/onboarding/GAL_ESCAPE_CASTLE_CA_CODING_AUDIT_RULES_V1.4.md
```

CA audit cadence:

```text
Level 1 = Regular CA Audit
Level 2 = Targeted Independent Closure Audit
Level 3 = Full Independent Snapshot Audit at accumulated/milestone scope
```

Procedural autonomy:

```text
When workflow already defines next owner + next action + permitted scope + closure condition,
execute without duplicate user approval.
```

Canonical ownership hardening:

```text
CD implementation need ≠ canonical write authority.
Other-role canonical sources require owner-first canonicalization.
Owner canonical commit and CD consumer implementation commit must be separate.
Every substantive CA audit performs a mandatory Canonical Ownership Check.
Unauthorized protected-source modification => BLOCKED — CANONICAL AUTHORITY VIOLATION.
```

---

## 4. Sprint / verification snapshot

```text
Sprint 0  = CLOSED
Sprint 1  = VERIFIED PASS
Sprint 2  = PASS
Sprint 3A = PASS
Sprint 3B = REMEDIATION CLOSURE PASS
Sprint 3C = VERIFIED PASS
Sprint 4  = VERIFIED PASS
Sprint 5  = VERIFIED PASS
Sprint 6  = VERIFIED PASS
Sprint 7  = BLOCKED PENDING LEVEL2 CLOSURE PASS
```

Sprint3C verified correction baseline:

```text
401a65847e94c534cd5e5458b865a304e510b74c
```

Sprint3C migration chain:

```text
database/015_sprint3c_minimal_safe_teacher_override.sql
database/016_sprint3c_level1_narrow_corrections.sql
database/017_sprint3c_override_act2_entry_correction.sql
```

Do not modify deployed migrations 001–017. At Sprint3C closure, migration 018 was next; current next unused migration is 037.

Do not modify deployed migrations 013 / 014 / 014a / 014b / 015. Any DB correction must remain additive.

## 5. Sprint3C closure / Sprint4 next gate

```text
S3C-CA-001 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
S3C-CA-002 HIGH   = FIXED_VERIFIED
Sprint3C gate     = PASS
```

Focused Level 1 re-audit:

```text
docs/audits/regular/runs/2026-09-23_sprint3c_level1_reaudit/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

Formal CA→CD PASS handoff:

```text
agent-comms/CA_to_CD_20260923T010444Z_sprint3c-focused-level1-reaudit-pass.md
```

Sprint4 was subsequently implemented and is now VERIFIED PASS; current gate is Sprint5 implementation.


---

Sprint4 scope approval:

```text
agent-comms/CA_to_CD_20260923T014439Z_sprint4-asset-manager-v2-scope-approved-with-canonical-coverage.md
```

Binding scope conditions:

```text
S4-SCOPE-01 = all 8 canonical lifecycle meanings must be supported
S4-SCOPE-02 = V4.0 §50.3 metadata + §50.7.5 sidecar minimum contracts preserved
S4-SCOPE-03 = registry/runtime identity+version authority must not silently split
```

## 6. Sprint4 closure / Sprint5 gate

```text
S4-CA-001 HIGH   = FIXED_VERIFIED
S4-CA-002 HIGH   = FIXED_VERIFIED
S4-CA-003 HIGH   = FIXED_VERIFIED
S4-CA-004 HIGH   = FIXED_VERIFIED
S4-CA-005 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
S4-CA-006 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
S4-CA-007 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
S4-RC-001 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
S4-RC-002 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
S4-RC-003 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
Sprint4 gate     = VERIFIED PASS
```

Third focused Level 1 re-audit:

```text
docs/audits/regular/runs/2026-09-24_sprint4_third_focused_level1_reaudit/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

Formal CA→CD PASS handoff:

```text
agent-comms/CA_to_CD_20260924T011000Z_sprint4-third-focused-level1-reaudit-pass-release-sprint5.md
```

Deployed migrations `018–036` are immutable. Next unused migration is `037`.

Sprint5 next-scope risk forecast has been delivered to CD.

## 7. Sprint5 closure / Sprint6 gate

```text
S5-CA-001 HIGH   = FIXED_VERIFIED
S5-CA-002 HIGH   = FIXED_VERIFIED
S5-CA-003 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
S5-RC-001 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
S5-RC-002 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
Sprint5 gate     = VERIFIED PASS
```

Final focused Level 1 re-audit:

```text
docs/audits/regular/runs/2026-09-24_sprint5_fourth_focused_level1_reaudit/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

Formal CA→CD PASS handoff:

```text
agent-comms/CA_to_CD_20260924T052400Z_sprint5-final-focused-reaudit-pass-release-sprint6.md
```

Verified correction baseline:

```text
e38db52e04211e746628f884f88bcbfd0bb7be50
```

Migrations `027–036` are immutable. Next unused migration is `037`.

Sprint6 risk-only forecast has been delivered to CD. Sprint6 canonical scope is ACT 9–13; ACT14 finalization/export and Sprint7 Teacher Console expansion remain outside this release.

---

## 8. Sprint6 historical closure / current Level2 gate

Sprint6 focused Level1 remains a historical bounded PASS. The higher-level ACT1–13 integrated gate remains BLOCKED after the first Level2 targeted closure audit.

```text
IDA-001 HIGH   = PARTIALLY_FIXED / NOT VERIFIED
IDA-002 MEDIUM = PARTIALLY_FIXED / OPEN
IDA-003 HIGH   = FIXED_VERIFIED
IDA-004 HIGH   = PARTIALLY_FIXED / NOT VERIFIED
IDA-005 HIGH   = PARTIALLY_FIXED / OPEN

Level2 gate = FAIL / BLOCKED
Sprint7 gate = BLOCKED
```

Level2 audit report:

```text
docs/audits/independent/runs/2026-09-24_level2_ida001-005_closure/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

Formal CA→CD handoff:

```text
agent-comms/CA_to_CD_20260924T160200Z_level2-ida-closure-fail-four-not-closed.md
```

Correction baseline audited:

```text
b4248132842a2e660ca1ba4e15605eff75c78dff
```

Migrations `001–039` are deployed history and immutable. Next unused migration is `040`.

CD must close residual IDA-001/002/004/005 and request another Level2 targeted closure audit. Sprint7 may be released only after Level2 PASS.

## 9. Visual / asset snapshot

Visual production may continue under Castle Visual V2.1 + `assets/asset-registry.json` governance.

```text
MASTER identities = canonical visual references
MASTER identities ≠ automatic runtime asset_keys
```

---

## 10. Memory-system adoption

Active adoption message:

```text
agent-comms/GA_to_ALL_20260920T153000Z_project-memory-system-adopted.md
```

Role Action Logs:

```text
docs/logs/GA_ACTION_LOG.csv
docs/logs/CA_ACTION_LOG.csv
docs/logs/CD_ACTION_LOG.csv
docs/logs/VA_ACTION_LOG.csv
```

---

## 11. When this snapshot is stale

Use, in order:

1. newer relevant Action Log entries after the recorded checkpoint;
2. newer valid agent-comms gate/handoff messages;
3. current canonical specs / repository state;
4. then refresh this L3 snapshot.

CURRENT STATUS must remain a short dashboard, not a development diary.
