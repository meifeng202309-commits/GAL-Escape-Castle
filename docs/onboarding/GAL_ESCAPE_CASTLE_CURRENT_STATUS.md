## 1. Project dashboard

```text
CURRENT_SPRINT        = Sprint 4
CURRENT_GATE          = BLOCKED_BY_SPRINT4_LEVEL1_AUDIT
CURRENT_OWNER         = CD
NEXT_REQUIRED_ACTION  = CD makes narrow additive corrections for S4-CA-001..007 using migration 024+ as needed, preserves deployed 018–023, runs adjacent regressions, and submits correction for focused Level 1 CA re-audit

MEMORY_SYSTEM         = ACTIVE
MEMORY_SYSTEM_START   = GA-001 / 2026-09-20
```

Visual production continues in parallel.

---

## 2. Action Log checkpoints

CA has completed its latest 10-action checkpoint through CA-050.

```text
GA_CHECKPOINT = NONE
CA_CHECKPOINT = CA-050
CD_CHECKPOINT = NONE
VA_CHECKPOINT = NONE
```

Universal cold-start entry:

```text
docs/onboarding/START_HERE.md
```

---

## 3. Current canonical / governance set

```text
L1 / current canonical:
docs/specs/current/古堡逃脱游戏脚本 V4.0.md
docs/specs/current/Codex程序开发说明书 V2.3.md
docs/specs/current/Castle Visual V2.1.md
docs/specs/current/从创意到游戏成品的研发流程V1.0.md
docs/specs/current/localization/GAL_Castle_Escape_Text_Catalog_V1.0.csv
assets/asset-registry.json

L2 / governance:
agent-comms/inter_agent_talk_protocol V1.md
docs/onboarding/START_HERE.md
docs/onboarding/GAL_ESCAPE_CASTLE_开发项目新成员指南_V1.0.md
docs/onboarding/GAL_ESCAPE_CASTLE_Agent_Action_Log_Rules_V1.0.md
docs/onboarding/GAL_ESCAPE_CASTLE_CA_CODING_AUDIT_RULES_V1.3.md
```

CA audit cadence:

```text
Level 1 = Regular CA Audit
Level 2 = Targeted Independent Closure Audit
Level 3 = Full Independent Snapshot Audit at accumulated/milestone scope
```

Procedural autonomy:

```text
When workflow already defines next owner + next action + permitted scope + closure condition,
execute without duplicate user approval.
```

---

## 4. Sprint / verification snapshot

```text
Sprint 0  = CLOSED
Sprint 1  = VERIFIED PASS
Sprint 2  = PASS
Sprint 3A = PASS
Sprint 3B = REMEDIATION CLOSURE PASS
Sprint 3C = VERIFIED PASS
Sprint 4  = LEVEL 1 AUDIT FAIL — NARROW CORRECTION REQUIRED
```

Sprint3C verified correction baseline:

```text
401a65847e94c534cd5e5458b865a304e510b74c
```

Sprint3C migration chain:

```text
database/015_sprint3c_minimal_safe_teacher_override.sql
database/016_sprint3c_level1_narrow_corrections.sql
database/017_sprint3c_override_act2_entry_correction.sql
```

Do not modify deployed migrations 001–017. Next unused migration is 018.

Do not modify deployed migrations 013 / 014 / 014a / 014b / 015. Any DB correction must remain additive.

---

## 5. Sprint3C closure / Sprint4 next gate

```text
S3C-CA-001 MEDIUM = FIXED_VERIFIED
S3C-CA-002 HIGH   = FIXED_VERIFIED
Sprint3C gate     = PASS
```

Focused Level 1 re-audit:

```text
docs/audits/regular/runs/2026-09-23_sprint3c_level1_reaudit/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

Formal CA→CD PASS handoff:

```text
agent-comms/CA_to_CD_20260923T010444Z_sprint3c-focused-level1-reaudit-pass.md
```

Sprint4 next-scope risk forecast has been delivered to CD. Sprint4 implementation is not yet broadly authorized; next step is bounded scope review.


---

Sprint4 scope approval:

```text
agent-comms/CA_to_CD_20260923T014439Z_sprint4-asset-manager-v2-scope-approved-with-canonical-coverage.md
```

Binding scope conditions:

```text
S4-SCOPE-01 = all 8 canonical lifecycle meanings must be supported
S4-SCOPE-02 = V4.0 §50.3 metadata + §50.7.5 sidecar minimum contracts preserved
S4-SCOPE-03 = registry/runtime identity+version authority must not silently split
```

## 6. Current Sprint4 blockers

```text
S4-CA-001 HIGH   = global Asset Manager Teacher authority can be self-issued via ordinary room creation
S4-CA-002 HIGH   = publisher automatically manufactures semantic APPROVED decision
S4-CA-003 HIGH   = paired activation can expose one-sided ACTIVE runtime state
S4-CA-004 HIGH   = registry hash/projection drift evidence can silently be stale/mixed
S4-CA-005 MEDIUM = Teacher anchor UI handles only required[0]
S4-CA-006 MEDIUM = register-before-upload can strand non-retriable PENDING_REVIEW state / incomplete lifecycle
S4-CA-007 MEDIUM = reusable publication path lacks stored-object SHA verification before publication record
```

Full Level 1 report:

```text
docs/audits/regular/runs/2026-09-23_sprint4_level1/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

Formal CA→CD handoff:

```text
agent-comms/CA_to_CD_20260923T031419Z_sprint4-level1-audit-fail-narrow-corrections.md
```

Deployed migrations `018–023` are verified unchanged and are immutable. Any DB correction begins at `024+`.

## 7. Visual / asset snapshot

Visual production may continue under Castle Visual V2.1 + `assets/asset-registry.json` governance.

```text
MASTER identities = canonical visual references
MASTER identities ≠ automatic runtime asset_keys
```

---

## 8. Memory-system adoption

Active adoption message:

```text
agent-comms/GA_to_ALL_20260920T153000Z_project-memory-system-adopted.md
```

Role Action Logs:

```text
docs/logs/GA_ACTION_LOG.csv
docs/logs/CA_ACTION_LOG.csv
docs/logs/CD_ACTION_LOG.csv
docs/logs/VA_ACTION_LOG.csv
```

---

## 9. When this snapshot is stale

Use, in order:

1. newer relevant Action Log entries after the recorded checkpoint;
2. newer valid agent-comms gate/handoff messages;
3. current canonical specs / repository state;
4. then refresh this L3 snapshot.

CURRENT STATUS must remain a short dashboard, not a development diary.
